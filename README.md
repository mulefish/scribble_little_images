# What is this? 
I am curious about Neural Nets. So far this will help create images ( the html page ) and resize those images ( the ImageResizer ) to train a NN. TODO: Write the NN.  

# lang 
python + browser

# Image resize, if needed:
Use ImageResizer to convert /static/images/ that are 256 by 256 pixels to /static/small_images/ that are 28 by 28 pix

# tests
None! Silly. This is a one off

# version4 
step A: node nn_version4_train.js   ( will write a weights file ) 
step B: node nn_verionn4_predict.js   ( will use the weights file as a model ) 

# output
![something here](./example.jpeg)
